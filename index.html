        <p>Team 7 was a Konohagakure team formed under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake.They were kinda a problematic group but they manage to balance out with their team dynamics.Two-and-a-half years after Sasuke Uchiha left the village, Kakashi filled out paperwork to form Team Kakashi, with his former pupils Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno now being treated as equals alongside their teacher.</p>
